# C-Programs

1st program
WAP to overload following operators for class distance, which stores the distance in feet
and inches.
a) Binary + to -add two objects (D3=Dl +D2)
   Operator +(dl ,d2);
    Dl .operator +(d2);
    -Add an object to an integer, where the integer should be added to the inches value (D2=4+D1)
b) Unary -

2nd program

Create a class which a complex number. Add two objects and display the resultant object.
Overload the ++ (post and operator for the class.

3rd Program

Create a class to store an integer array. Overload insertion and extraction
operator to input and display the array elements.

4th program
Create a class which allocates the memory for a string through dynamic constructor.
Overload the binary + to concatenate two strings and display it.
Overload the assignment operator.

5th
WAP to add two objects of time class. Overload the operator ‘==’ to
compare two objects and display whether they are equal or not. Overload the
assignment operator.

6th
WAP to add two objects of distance class. Overload the operator ‘&gt;’ to
compare two objects and return the object with larger time value and
display it. Overload the ‘==’ operator to compare and display whether two
given objects contain same distance value.

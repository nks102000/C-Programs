# C-Programs

1st Program
(Function Template) Define a function template for finding the minimum
value contained in an array. Write main() function to find the minimum
value of integer array and minimum value of floating point numbers in an
array.

2nd Program
(Function Template) Write a program to define the function template for
swapping the two items of various data types such as integers, float and
characters etc.

3rd Program
(Function Template) Write a template function to search for a given key
element from an array. Illustrate how you perform search in integer,
character as well as double arrays using the same template function.

4th Program
(Non-type as function parameters) Write a program to demonstrate the
concept behind function templates with non-type as function parameters by
taking sorting an array of numbers as an examples.

5th Program
(Class Template) Write a program to define a class template for reading
two data items from the keyboard and find out their sum.

6th Program
(Class Template) Write a class template to represent a generic vector.
Include member functions to perform the following tasks:
 To create the vector.
 To modify the value of a given element.
 To multiply the vector by a scalar value.
 To display the vector in the form (10, 20, 30,…..).

7th Program
(Class Template) Write a program to explain class template by creating a
template T for a class named pair having two data members of type T which
are inputted by a constructor and a member function get-max() return the
greatest of two numbers to main. Note: the value of T depends upon the data
type specified during object creation.

8th Program
(Class Template) Design a generic stack class which can be used to create
integer, character or floating point stack objects. Provide all necessary data
members and member functions (push, pop, display &amp , default constructor)
to operate on the stack.

10th Program
(Class Template) Program to create a class called QUEUE with the
member functions to add and to delete an element from the queue. Using
these functions, implement a queue of integer and double. Demonstrate the
operations by displaying the contents of the queue after every operation.
